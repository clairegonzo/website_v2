I am a PhD student studying the co-location of aquaculture systems with renewable energy in the marine environment. 
I conduct this research as part of the Froehlich Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
In my free time, I am happiest in the water, on the trail, or drinking coffee somewhere.
